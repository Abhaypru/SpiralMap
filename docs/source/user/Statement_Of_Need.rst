Statement of Need
=================

Motivation
----------

Understanding the spiral structure of the Milky Way is a fundamental problem in Galactic astronomy. 
Different tracers—ranging from HII regions, HI gas, near-infrared (NIR) emission, masers, OB stars, to Cepheid variables—provide unique insights into the location, number, and geometry of spiral arms.

However, these models are often scattered across literature, implemented in varied formats, or hard to reproduce and compare directly.

Purpose of SpiralMap
--------------------

**SpiralMap** is developed to address this fragmentation by:

- **Consolidating multiple spiral arm models** from the literature into a unified, accessible Python package.
- **Standardizing model interfaces**, allowing users to interact with various models in a consistent manner.
- **Enabling comparative studies** between different models using shared plotting and analysis tools.
- **Promoting reproducibility** by embedding publication references, default parameters, and citation-ready outputs.

Scope
-----

SpiralMap includes both analytical spiral arm models and data-driven maps (e.g., from Gaia and Poggio et al.). It is designed for:

- Galactic structure researchers.
- Data scientists exploring spatial patterns in the Milky Way.
- Educators and students looking to visualize the Galaxy’s structure.

Future extensions may include integration with 3D visualizations, interactive notebooks, and tools for custom model fitting.
