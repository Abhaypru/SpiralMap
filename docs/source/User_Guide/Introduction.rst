Mapping the structure of the Milky Way has been a central pursuit in astronomy for many decades. Through extensive observations, astronomers have developed a detailed understanding of the Galaxy’s main components, including the disc, bulge, and halo. Features that break the Galaxy's symmetry—such as the central bar and sweeping spiral arms—are of particular interest.

Numerous surveys, spanning radio to optical wavelengths, have revealed the rich and varied spiral structure of the Milky Way. However, even when machine-readable data for spiral arm models are available, extracting coordinates or overlaying spiral arms on custom plots can be a challenge for users.

The ``spiralmap`` package addresses these challenges by providing a convenient and unified interface to major spiral arm models published in the literature. With ``spiralmap``, users can easily extract cartesian coordinates and overplot spiral arms in commonly used coordinate frames, including heliocentric, galactocentric, and polar projections.

A summary of the spiral arm models currently included in the package is provided in :ref:`tab-modsummary`. While this list is not exhaustive, it covers the principal models that shape our current understanding of the Milky Way’s spiral structure. Suggestions for additional models and community contributions are welcome.

For a walkthrough of the package’s features and usage, continue with the next sections or jump directly to the :ref:`quickstart` guide.
